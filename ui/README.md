# Frontend of the application

    -This is a react-app application, build your front end as you would any other react application.

    Keep in mind cors on your back end lets you fetch your api via (localhost:8080/<endpoints>)
    
    Read through the dependencies in the package.json and add any additional packages you want.

    Customize your Frontend as needed.
